## Course Description
This course explores the design and integration of data-centric systems across **edge-to-cloud networks**. Core topics include **sensor networks**, **5G wireless and core architectures**, **mobile edge and cloud computing**, **edge intelligence**, and **networking for AI workloads**.  

Application domains such as the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **industrial automation**, and **real-time data analytics** will be examined. Students will analyze case studies on efficient mobile data collection, processing, and intelligent decision-making in contexts ranging from **autonomous intelligence** to **immersive applications**.  

Emphasis is placed on both the **modeling and synthesis** of edge-to-cloud systems, as well as **hands-on experience** with data-centric platforms for deploying distributed AI solutions.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. **Explain** the architectural roles of edge devices, networks, and cloud platforms in data-centric networked systems.  
2. **Understand and evaluate** existing data collection protocols and cloud/edge computing methodologies for supporting AI-driven solutions.  
3. **Analyze** trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, energy efficiency, and scalability in edge-to-cloud computing deployments.  
4. **Apply** data management and streaming techniques to AI and analytics workloads across distributed infrastructures.  
5. **Evaluate** case studies in IoT, industrial automation, and immersive communications using performance metrics.  
6. **Customize** computing and communication pipelines to fit within the compute and energy envelopes of edge devices and network infrastructures.  
7. **Implement** a prototype edge-to-cloud application using contemporary platforms and tools (e.g., IoT devices, cloud services, containerized deployments).
